# Remote Claude Deployment Models - Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

### 1. Architecture Documentation
- **Deployment Models** (`docs/architecture/deployment-models.md`)
  - Comprehensive overview of self-serve vs hosted SaaS models
  - Technical architecture for both approaches
  - Freemium tier structure ($0 / $29 / Enterprise)
  - Implementation phases and timelines

- **Authentication Design** (`docs/architecture/auth-design.md`)
  - OAuth2 flow for GitHub/Google login
  - CLI authentication mechanism
  - Database schema for user management
  - Security measures and API endpoints

### 2. Self-Serve Infrastructure (AWS)
- **CloudFormation Template** (`deploy/aws/cloudformation.yaml`)
  - Complete ECS cluster setup
  - Auto-scaling EC2 instances with spot support
  - VPC, subnets, and security groups
  - S3 bucket for task results
  - IAM roles and policies
  
- **Deployment Script** (`deploy/aws/deploy.sh`)
  - Interactive setup wizard
  - Prerequisites checking
  - Automatic rclaude configuration
  - Cost estimation display

### 3. CLI Enhancements
- **New Init Deployment Command** (`src/cli/commands/init-deployment.ts`)
  - Interactive deployment mode selection
  - AWS deployment with CloudFormation
  - Cost estimation and warnings
  - Automatic configuration after deployment

## Quick Start

### Self-Hosted Deployment (Available Now)
```bash
# Option 1: Using the new init command
rclaude init-deployment --mode self-hosted

# Option 2: Direct deployment script
cd deploy/aws
./deploy.sh
```

### Using ECS After Deployment
```bash
# Run a task on your ECS cluster
rclaude run <task-id> --provider ecs-ec2

# Interactive mode
rclaude run <task-id> --provider ecs-ec2 --interactive
```

## Cost Breakdown (Self-Hosted AWS)

| Instance Type | On-Demand | Spot (70% off) | Monthly (24/7) |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| t3.micro     | $0.0104/hr| $0.0031/hr    | ~$2.32         |
| t3.medium    | $0.0416/hr| $0.0125/hr    | ~$9.36         |
| c5.large     | $0.085/hr | $0.0255/hr    | ~$19.13        |

*Additional costs: Data transfer, storage, CloudWatch logs*

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test the self-hosted deployment**
   - Run `rclaude init-deployment`
   - Verify ECS cluster creation
   - Run a test task

2. **Add to CLI** (needs to be done)
   - Add init-deployment command to cli.ts
   - Update help documentation
   - Test end-to-end flow

### Phase 2: SaaS API Development
1. Set up Express/FastAPI backend
2. Implement OAuth2 authentication
3. Create user management database
4. Build task execution API

### Phase 3: Web Dashboard
1. Next.js frontend setup
2. Authentication integration
3. Task management UI
4. Billing integration

## Architecture Decisions Still Needed

1. **API Framework**: FastAPI (Python) vs Express (Node.js) vs Go
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL vs DynamoDB
3. **Queue System**: SQS vs Redis vs RabbitMQ
4. **Payment Provider**: Stripe vs Paddle
5. **Monitoring**: DataDog vs CloudWatch vs Prometheus

## Security Considerations

### Self-Hosted
- IAM roles follow least privilege
- VPC isolation for compute resources
- Encrypted S3 bucket for results
- Security group restrictions

### Hosted SaaS (Future)
- SOC 2 compliance roadmap
- Container isolation per user
- API rate limiting
- Encrypted data at rest/transit

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `rclaude init-deployment` end-to-end
- [ ] Deploy CloudFormation stack
- [ ] Verify ECS cluster is running
- [ ] Run a test task on ECS
- [ ] Test spot instance deployment
- [ ] Verify auto-scaling works
- [ ] Check CloudWatch logs
- [ ] Test stack deletion

## Questions for Product Decisions

1. **Pricing**: Is $29/month for Pro tier competitive?
2. **Free Tier Limits**: 100 executions enough for trial?
3. **Enterprise Features**: What additional features needed?
4. **Regional Deployment**: Which AWS regions to support?
5. **Compliance**: HIPAA/SOC2/ISO27001 requirements?

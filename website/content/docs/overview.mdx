# Remote Claude

Remote Claude is a powerful CLI tool that enables you to run Claude Code tasks remotely on GitHub Codespaces or AWS EC2 instances. It's designed to make AI-powered development workflows more efficient and scalable.

## Why Remote Claude?

- **Save and Reuse Tasks**: Define tasks once, run them anywhere
- **Remote Execution**: Leverage cloud compute for resource-intensive tasks
- **Multiple Backends**: Choose between GitHub Codespaces and AWS EC2
- **Project Management**: Organize tasks by project with local configuration
- **Real-time Notifications**: Get notified when long-running tasks complete

## Key Features

### Task-Based Workflow

```bash
# Run a saved task
rclaude run refactor-auth

# Create a new task on the fly
rclaude run implement-search
```

### Multi-Backend Support

- **GitHub Codespaces**: Perfect for quick tasks and existing GitHub projects
- **AWS EC2**: Ideal for long-running tasks and custom environments

### Smart Configuration

Remote Claude uses a hierarchical configuration system:

1. CLI flags (highest priority)
2. Task-specific defaults
3. Project configuration (`.rclaude.json`)
4. Global configuration (`~/.rclauderc`)

## Getting Started

1. Install Remote Claude:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @rclaude/cli
   ```

2. Configure your preferred backend:
   ```bash
   rclaude config backend
   ```

3. Run your first task:
   ```bash
   rclaude run "add dark mode to my app"
   ```

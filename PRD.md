# Remote Claude - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

Remote Claude is a cloud-based development platform that enables developers to run Claude Code tasks remotely on scalable infrastructure. It combines the power of AI-assisted coding with efficient resource management, providing a seamless experience for automating development tasks at scale.

## Product Vision

To become the standard platform for AI-powered remote development, making it as easy to run complex coding tasks in the cloud as it is to run them locally, while providing enterprise-grade security, scalability, and cost efficiency.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Resource Limitations**: Local machines often lack the computational resources for large-scale AI coding tasks
2. **Context Switching**: Developers waste time setting up environments and switching between projects
3. **Collaboration Barriers**: Difficult to share AI coding sessions and collaborate in real-time
4. **Cost Inefficiency**: Running dedicated cloud instances for each task is expensive
5. **Tool Fragmentation**: No unified platform for managing AI coding tasks across different environments

### Target Users

```

### Data Flow
1. User creates task via CLI/UI
2. Task manager assigns to available instance
3. Container manager creates/reuses repository container
4. Claude SDK processes task with AI assistance
5. Results stream back to user in real-time
6. Task completion triggers cleanup

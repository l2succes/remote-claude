## üìù Notes

### MCP Management Priority
As requested, MCP (Model Context Protocol) management is a high priority feature that will allow users to:
- Configure which MCP servers are available for tasks
- Set per-task or global MCP configurations
- Monitor MCP server health and status
- Easily add custom MCPs

### Architecture Decisions
- Container-per-repository (not per-task) for efficiency
- Shared instances with proper isolation
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Modular architecture for easy extension

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Create remote-claude-agent package for containers
2. Build Docker image with agent and Claude Code
3. Implement ECS Exec for command execution
4. Create backend API with WebSocket proxy
5. Build minimal web UI for v0
6. Test end-to-end workflow
